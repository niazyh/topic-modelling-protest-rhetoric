# topic-modelling-protest-rhetoric

**Analysing UK parliamentary debates on protest using structural topic modelling**

This project explores the latent themes that have run through politicians’ speeches about protest in the UK House of Commons over the last 50 years. The transcripts from any debates discussing protest, and from changes to legislation covering protest, are analysed using topic modelling via the stm package in R. Through uncovering the latent patterns and themes in parliamentary discourse, I seek to understand the ways in which politicians have framed protest and police power in the UK. In doing so, I answer the following questions:

1. What latent themes lie underneath politicians’ discussion of political protest in House of Commons debates?

2. How does party affiliation affect politicians’ framing of political protest?
